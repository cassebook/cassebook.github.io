This is an example of the companion page for a chapter.  
It's written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which makes it easy to write content as a simple text file.

* You can have [links](http://www.google.com)

* You can have code snippets:

```python
def proc(arg):
  if arg:
    print('hello world')
```

* You can directly include arbitrary HTML:

<table border="2">
    <tr>
        <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Example code

You can also include linked files: 
[program1.py]({{ site.url }}/code/ch01/program1.py.html) 
([download]({{ site.url }}/code/ch01/program1.py)).  
I've used [pygmentize](http://pygments.org) 
to color the code, which will work for practically any language.
